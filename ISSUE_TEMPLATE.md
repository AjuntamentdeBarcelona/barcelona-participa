### IMPORTANT NOTE

This is the opensource code repository for "decidim.barcelona", based on [Consul](https://github.com/consul/consul), developed by the Madrid City government. This is a fork that was used between 1 of february of 2016 to the 8 of february of 2017.

This repository is deprecated and is here only for transparency. It was used initially for the PAM (Municipal Action Plan, a strategic planning participatory process) and for working as an alpha version for the participatory process configurator.

**Warning**: this version of *decidim.barcelona* isn't meant to be reused; if you want to build your own project on top of it, take a look at [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim) or [Consul](https://github.com/consul/consul) instead.
